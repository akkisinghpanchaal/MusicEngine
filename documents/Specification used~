We want to use "USER STORIES" for our project because user stories is more detailed and more result oriented than use cases and backlogs. Use cases is just a flow of the things to be done and backlogs just give what have to be done in the applicationin a more crude way. Coming to srs it contains all the requirements but User Stories enables us to think as the user and his requirments and its a  simple and easy representation flow which enables us to land at the result.
